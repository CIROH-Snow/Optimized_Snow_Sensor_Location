A Guassian mixture model (GMM) to locate points in a region that best capture the feature space diversity of the region. The funcs.py file contains functions to run a GMM over a physiographic feature space. The model combines multiple, multivariate distributions of the features to converge on locations which optimize the ability of the limited number of sensor sites to represent all points in the feature space.
